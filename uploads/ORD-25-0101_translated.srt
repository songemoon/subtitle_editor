Lovey, when will I see you again?
What's the matter, Lovey?
Don't you know I'm getting married in a few days, Lovey?
Thought you were cool, Lovey, but I guess not.
This is fun.
I'm Jang Yong-won.
Why would I do that?
Lovey is a woman too, she just asked out of fear of upsetting you.
I'm a good guy, Lovey.
Thanks, honey.
